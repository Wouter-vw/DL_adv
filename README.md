# Reimplementation and Extension of "Riemannian Laplace approximations for Bayesian neural networks"

This repository houses the reimplementation code and the original paper's code with modification to log runtime and accuracy to a CSV file. 

The folder "riemannian-laplace-approximation" houses the original paper's code, with a relevant readme describing how we ran our tests inside. 

The folder "JAX-RIEM-LA" houses our reimplementation code and a readme describing how to run the same tests as described in our report. 

The folder "solver_comparison" contains the code required to compare various diffrax solvers to find the optimal settings for the relevant ODE.

The folder "analysis" contains our analysis on the data files, which can be found in the folder itself, as well as in "JAX-RIEM-LA" and "riemannian-laplace-approximation".
